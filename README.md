# ECX 6.0 Final Project: Interactive Quiz Application

A dynamic, Single Page Application (SPA) built to test users' knowledge of Web Development. This project focuses on semantic HTML, modern CSS layouts, and vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 Features
- **SPA Architecture:** Transitions between start, quiz, and result screens without page reloads.
- **Dynamic Content:** Questions are loaded from a JavaScript Array of Objects, making it easy to scale.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Real-time visual cues (Green/Red) let users know if their answer was correct.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile screens using Flexbox and Grid.
- **Score Tracking:** Automatically calculates and displays the final score at the end.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Custom styling with Flexbox/Grid and state management utility classes.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** DOM manipulation, event listeners, and asynchronous timing functions.
